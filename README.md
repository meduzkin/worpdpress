Wordpress testing job for 2month period.

The application should be launched at a click, with a minimum of interventions.
Required to type "docker-compose up", push enter and let's the magic begins!

The launch takes place in 3 stages.
1. Build the site;
2. Build the MySQL database;
3. Build Redis as a store of php sessions.
4. Open in your favourite browser http://124.0.0.76/
5. Enjoy
